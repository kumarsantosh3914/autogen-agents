**Enhanced Mediterranean Miso Ramen with Olive Oil Caviar**

**Ingredients:**

- **Broth:**
  - 4 cups vegetable stock
  - 2 tablespoons white miso paste
  - 1 tablespoon tahini
  - 1-2 teaspoons harissa, depending on your spice preference
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon lemon zest
  - A sprig of fresh rosemary
  - A pinch of saffron threads for a luxurious aroma

- **Noodles & Protein:**
  - 200g whole wheat ramen noodles
  - 200g chickpeas, roasted with smoked paprika, garlic powder, and a hint of cumin

- **Toppings:**
  - Grilled artichoke hearts
  - Sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
  - Kalamata olives, pitted and halved
  - Fresh basil leaves
  - Crumbled feta cheese or vegan feta
  - Olive oil caviar (see recipe below)

**Olive Oil Caviar:**
- 1/2 cup high-quality olive oil
- 1 cup vegetable oil (chilled in the freezer for at least 30 minutes)
- 1 gram agar-agar powder
- 1/4 cup water

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Broth:**
   In a large pot, combine the vegetable stock, miso paste, tahini, harissa, soy sauce, lemon zest, saffron threads, and rosemary. Simmer gently over medium heat to infuse the flavors. Remove the rosemary before serving.

2. **Cook the Noodles:**
   Prepare the whole wheat ramen noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

3. **Roast the Chickpeas:**
   Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss chickpeas with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and cumin. Roast for 15-20 minutes until crispy.

4. **Make Olive Oil Caviar:**
   In a small saucepan, heat water and agar-agar powder until dissolved. Stir in the olive oil. Using a dropper, drop the mixture into the chilled vegetable oil. The droplets will solidify into caviar-like spheres. Rinse gently in cold water and set aside.

5. **Assemble the Ramen:**
   Place noodles in bowls. Pour the aromatic broth over them. Top with roasted chickpeas, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and basil leaves.

6. **Finishing Touches:**
   Sprinkle with feta or vegan feta. Garnish with olive oil caviar for a burst of smooth, rich flavor.

This dish not only tantalizes the taste buds but also adds an interactive and visually stunning element with the olive oil caviar. It’s a modern twist on your Mediterranean Miso Ramen, perfect for culinary adventurers seeking a sensory experience. Enjoy your flavorful masterpiece!
